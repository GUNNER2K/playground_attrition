# playground_attrition
This repo contains the notebook for the recent kaggle playground tabular series 
although the performance is not upto the mark , this is the best that I could do . 
the problem statement : The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on a Employee Attrition. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
### Files :
train.csv - the training dataset; Attrition is the binary target
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of positive Attrition
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

Some insights :
